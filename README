This is used for ansible dynamic and static inventories.

IMPORTANT!

The script and static inventory files are in ./stat_and_dyn

stat_and_dyn/sat_inventory.py - Python script for querying the satellite server
stat_and_dyn/stat_hosts - a list of static hosts that are not in satellite, if changes are required please commit and push this back to git

Configuration of the dynamic inventory needs to go to:
conf/config.py

If this does not already exist copy:
cp conf/config.py.default conf/config.py

Modify it as required, you will need to add the user credentails "ansible_inventory" to the satellite server with readonly access.

The rest of the defaults should be sufficent.

USAGE:
Get a list of avaialble host collections:
[user@ansible-host sat_dynamic_inventory]$ stat_and_dyn/sat_inventory.py | grep '\['

Use ansible to query via the dynamic and static hosts:

[user@ansible-host sat_dynamic_inventory]$ ansible -i stat_and_dyn/ all --list-hosts


Use ansible to query via the dynamic and static hosts with an intersection of host-collections:
[user@ansible-host sat_dynamic_inventory]$ ansible -i stat_and_dyn/ 'RHEL_6_Servers:&PROD' --list-hosts
